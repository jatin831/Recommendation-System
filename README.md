# Recommendation-System
We build this project for CodeMeNot hackathon 2021. A system to recommend the best course according to user's choices.

Preferences of the user are taken at every step in his/her priority order which will lead to the products that could be recommended. Used weight assigning and hashing techniques to calculate priority values for each of the associated product and then the top 3-5 products are recommended.
